    \section{Introduction}

    The purpose of this note is to provide a streamlined proof of a particular case of a construction presented in \cite{CPTT23}, in order to better understand the general formalism developed therein. We attempt to make this note self-contained, but nevertheless urge the reader to refer to the original paper for more detailed discussion and generalizations of the results we have selected to include here.

    \subsection{Treeings of equivalence relations}

    A \textit{countable Borel equivalence relation (CBER)} on a standard Borel space $X$ is a Borel equivalence relation $E\subseteq X^2$ with each class countable. We are interested in special types of \textit{graphings} on a CBER $E\subseteq X^2$, i.e. a Borel graph $G\subseteq X^2$ whose connectedness relation is precisely $E$. For instance, a graphing of $E$ such that each component is a tree is called a \textit{treeing} of $E$, and the CBERs that admit a treeing are said to be \textit{treeable}. The main results of \cite{CPTT23} is to provide new sufficient criteria for treeability of CBERs, and in particular, they prove the following

    \begin{mainTheorem}[\cite{CPTT23}*{Theorem 1.1}]
        If a CBER admits a locally-finite graphing whose components are quasi-trees, then it is treeable.
    \end{mainTheorem}

    Recall that metric spaces $X$ and $Y$ are \textit{quasi-isometric} if they are isometric up to a bounded multiplicative and additive error, and $X$ is a \textit{quasi-tree} if it is quasi-isometric to a simplicial tree; see \cite{Gro93} and \cite{DK18}.

    \subsection{Outline of the proof}

    Roughly speaking, the existence of a quasi-isometry $G|C\to T_C$ to a simplicial tree $T_C$ for each component $C\subseteq G$ induces a collection $\mc{H}(C)$ of `cuts' (subsets $H\subseteq C$ with finite boundary such that both $H$ and $C\comp H$ are connected), which are `tree-like' in the sense that
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item[1.] $\mc{H}(C)$ is \textit{finitely-separating}: each vertex $x\in C$ is on the boundary of finitely-many $H\in\mc{H}(C)$, and
        \item[2.] $\mc{H}(C)$ is \textit{dense towards ends}: each end in $G|C$ has a neighborhood basis in $\mc{H}(C)$.
    \end{enumerate}
    These cuts have the structure of a pocset with non-trivial points isolated, which in turn provide exactly the data to construct a `median graph' whose vertices are `ultrafilters' thereof. Condition (2) then ensures that this graph has finite `hyperplanes', which allows us to apply a Borel `cycle-cutting' algorithm and obtain a canonical spanning tree thereof. Each step above can be done in a uniform way to each component $C\subseteq G$, giving us the desired treeing of the CBER.
